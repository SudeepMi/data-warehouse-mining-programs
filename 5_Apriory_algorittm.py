# Association-rule-mining-via-apriori-algorithm
#Let's suppose that we want rules for only those items that are purchased at least 5 times a day, or 7 x 5 = 35 times in one week, since our dataset is for a one-week time period. The support for those items can be calculated as 35/7500 = 0.0045. The minimum confidence for the rules is 20% or 0.2. Similarly, we specify the value for lift as 3 and finally min_length is 2 since we want at least two products in our rules. These values are mostly just arbitrarily chosen, so you can play with these values and see what difference it makes in the rules you get back out.
